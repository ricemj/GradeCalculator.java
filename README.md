# Grade Calculator

This project is designed for students to be able to efficiently input
data and receive calculations that help them have a better understanding
of their academic progress.

## Introduction

There are many types of grade calculators accessible online, but I 
found that each type were separate and time consuming to search for. 
To fix this issue, I consolidated all the different calculators I used
into one program. 

The first calculator is a final grade calculator to process what
grade you need on your final exam to get a specific grade in a class.
The second calculator outputs a semester's GPA based on the
individual classes' GPA. The final calculator displays cumulative 
GPA from letter grade inputs. 

In the future, I want to add a feature to store the output's on a
CSV file and add a GUI for a better user experience.

## How to install

1. Download the repository as a .zip file and unzip.
2. Open the Main.java file in a Java IDE. 
3. Run the file and follow the program's directions to use the
different calculators.
